### To do
- convert to MVC
See: https://www.taniarascia.com/javascript-mvc-todo-app/
- create new repl so there is one for the arrow keys example and another which uses the api

### Done
- make an api call to a words api
this looks really good, use the /sug endpoint

- detect keyboard events on mobile. They weren't being detected before because on a mobile the first letter is capitalized. Problem solved by making all letters all lowercase
